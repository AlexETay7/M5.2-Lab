          <font size="6">The Trouble with Bears</font>
        </div>
        <p><strong>By Evan Wild</strong></p>
      
        <p>
          Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, 
          self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from 
          the renowned documentary, <em>The Jungle Book</em>.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? 
          In this article, we try to answer those questions and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>
      
        <font size="5">Types of Bear</font>
        <p>
          Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, 
          then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.
        </p>
      
        <p>
          Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home 
          in urban areas as they are in the countryside. Different habitats encourage different behavior, as shown 
          in the table below.

          <font size="5">Habitats and Eating Habits</font>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. They typically 
          hunt for food in woodlands or rivers, but may also seek sustenance from farms or country houses. They 
          tend to live in relative isolation, in caves, tents, or cottages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Urban (gentrified) bears, on the other hand, have largely abandoned the old ways. They may hunt other 
          urban creatures but prefer scavenging from dumpsters, bins, and fast food outlets. Some even break 
          into people's kitchens to steal essentials like baked beans and microwave ovens.
        </p>
      
        <img src="media/urban-bear.jpg" alt="An urban bear in a cage.">
      
        <p>
          Urban bears will sleep anywhere they can, from bus shelters and parks to McDonald's bathrooms or their 
          own apartments.
        </p>
      
        <font size="5">Mating Rituals</font>
        <p>
          Bears are romantic creatures by nature, seeking a lifelong mate. They attract partners by decorating 
          their dwellings—wild bears may create cave paintings or beds of reeds, while urban bears opt for mood 
          lighting and a Michael Bublé CD.

                  Oh, I am so glad you taught me all about the big brown angry guys in the woods. With their 
                  sniffing little noses and their bad attitudes, they can sure be a menace—I was thinking of 
                  putting them all in a truck and driving them outta here. I run a zoo, you know.
